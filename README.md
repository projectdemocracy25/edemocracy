## Vision

eDemocracy Platform is an open-source platform designed to empower citizens worldwide to engage in constructive political discourse, share local issues and ideas, and hold politicians accountable.  We aim to bridge the gap between citizens and their governments, fostering a more informed, engaged, and responsive democracy, starting with *your* community.

## Core Principles

*   **Global Reach, Local Focus:**  eDemocracy Platform connects you with your local community first, while also allowing you to explore issues and ideas from around the world.
*   **Transparency:**  The platform's code, data (with strict privacy safeguards), and decision-making processes are open and accessible.
*   **Constructive Dialogue:**  We prioritize respectful and evidence-based discussions, using AI to facilitate positive communication.
*   **Citizen-Driven:**  The platform is shaped by the needs and ideas of its users.
*   **Accountability:**  We aim to track political promises and actions, providing a clear picture of how well politicians are serving the public.
*   **Open Source & Non-Profit:**  We believe in the power of collaboration and are committed to remaining free, open-source, and non-profit.
*   **Privacy:** We are committed to protecting user data and complying with all relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) (create this file).

## Features (Current & Planned)

**Phase 1 (Current - Minimum Viable Product):**

*   **Localized Landing Page:**  Upon visiting, you'll be automatically connected to your local community (based on IP address or user selection).  The landing page features:
    *   **Local Statistics:**  A snapshot of key issues and discussions in your area.
    *   **AI-Powered Input:**  A simple, ChatGPT-like input field where you can immediately describe a problem or share an idea.  The AI will analyze your input, categorize it, and ensure it's presented constructively.
*   **Idea Submission & Problem Sharing:**  Share your ideas and highlight problems you face, categorized by topic.
*   **AI-Moderated Discussions:**  Engage in constructive conversations, with AI helping to rephrase toxic comments and suggest relevant information.
*   **Basic Voting & Support:**  Upvote/downvote ideas to gauge community interest.
*   **User Profiles:**  Participate anonymously or pseudonymously.

**Phase 2 (Planned - Enhanced Features):**

*   **AI-Powered Fact-Checking:**  Integration with fact-checking resources to assess the validity of claims.
*   **Community Moderation:**  Empowering trusted users to assist with moderation.
*   **Idea Refinement Tools:**  Collaboratively develop and refine ideas.
*   **Politician Program Matching:**  Compare user-generated ideas with existing political platforms.
*   **Accountability Timeline:**  Track politician promises and progress.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Full support for multiple languages.

**Phase 3 (Long-Term Vision):**

*   **Direct Politician Interaction (Carefully Moderated):**  A channel for politicians to engage with citizen concerns.
*   **Civic Tech Integration:**  Connect with other platforms for civic action.
*   **Decentralization:**  Explore options for decentralizing the platform.
*   **Open Source AI Model Training:**  Transition to using and fine-tuning open-source LLMs.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure the platform is fully accessible to users with disabilities.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a framework like React, Vue.js, or Svelte recommended)
*   **Backend:**  Initially SQLite (for rapid prototyping), migrating to PostgreSQL for production.
*   **AI:**  Initially Google AI Studio (Gemini Pro), with a *mandatory* transition plan to open-source models (e.g., from Hugging Face) for transparency and long-term sustainability.  We will prioritize models that support multiple languages.
*   **API:** RESTful API
*   **Geolocation:**  IP-based geolocation service (e.g., IPinfo, MaxMind) for initial localization.

*   **Transparency Report:**  We will publish a regular transparency report detailing all donations received, how they were used, and the operational costs of the platform.  This report will be publicly accessible.
*   **Open Collective/GitHub Sponsors:** We will explore using platforms like Open Collective or GitHub Sponsors to manage donations transparently.

**Security Considerations:**

*   **User Data:**  We will prioritize user data privacy and security, employing best practices for data encryption, access control, and secure coding.
*   **AI Model Security:**  We will carefully vet any integrated AI models (especially open-source ones) for potential vulnerabilities and biases.  We will implement monitoring and auditing procedures.
